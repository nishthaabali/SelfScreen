## Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning
# Overview
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on clinical and diagnostic data. The primary goal is to use a dataset containing features extracted from fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast cancer tumors to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The project utilizes various machine learning techniques to build a predictive model, optimize its performance, and create a user-friendly interface for deployment.

# Project Details

Dataset: The model uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD), which consists of 30 feature attributes and the class labels ('malignant' and 'benign').

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to ensure it is ready for machine learning algorithms.
Model Training: Implementing and training different machine learning models to predict breast cancer.
Performance Evaluation: Comparing the performance of various models based on classification accuracy and other relevant metrics.
User Interface: An interactive web app built with Streamlit to allow users to input new data and get predictions.
Model Persistence: The trained model is saved in a .sav file for later use and deployment.
